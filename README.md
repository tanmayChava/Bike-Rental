## 📌 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Demand prediction using machine learning
- Visual dashboards and reporting
- Time-based and weather-based rental pattern analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Flask/Django for web deployment
- (Optional) Streamlit for dashboard

## 📊 Data Description

Dataset includes:

- Date and time
- Weather conditions
- Temperature and humidity
- Number of bike rentals (casual, registered, total)

Sample columns:
- `datetime`
- `season`
- `holiday`
- `workingday`
- `weather`
- `temp`
- `humidity`
- `windspeed`
- `casual`
- `registered`
- `count`

## 🔍 EDA Highlights

- Peak hours for bike rentals
- Impact of weather and holidays on demand
- Seasonal trends
- Correlation heatmaps

## 🔮 Model Performance

- Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
- Best model: Random Forest (R² = 0.89)
